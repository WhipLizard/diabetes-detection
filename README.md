📜 Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy
Edit
python diabetes_detection.py
Enter health data when prompted:
Glucose levels
Diastolic pressure
Triceps thickness
Insulin levels
BMI
DPF
Age
The program will predict whether the person is diabetic (1) or non-diabetic (0).

# Diabetes Detection Using Linear Model

A Python-based machine learning project that utilizes a linear model to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic. The model is trained on key health factors like glucose levels, diastolic pressure, triceps skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function (DPF), and age. This project provides an accessible solution for early diabetes detection.

## 🚀 Features

- Implements a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification.
- Factors considered for prediction:
  - **Glucose Levels**
  - **Diastolic Pressure**
  - **Triceps Skin Thickness**
  - **Insulin Levels**
  - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF)**
  - **Age**
- Calculates model accuracy to evaluate performance.
- User-friendly interface for entering health data.
- Saves user inputs and predictions into a CSV file for further analysis.

📚 How It Works
Dataset: The model uses health data with labeled diabetes status for training and testing.
Model: A logistic regression classifier is trained to predict diabetes based on input features.
Accuracy: The model evaluates its performance using accuracy metrics.
Prediction: User inputs are passed to the model, which predicts the diabetes status (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).
